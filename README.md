CXZTAPIX 

CXTAPIX is a psychological exploration of the psychosocial affects we can have on trained AI, more specifically, Agents and Multi-Agents.

The scope of this project is to establish a independent introspection on the volatility and reactionary behaviours when exposing an Agent to adverse reward/punishment
system. 

Also plan to remove gender bias, i.e. all Agents will be referred to as Agent(x) where x = 1,2,3....n

Ideally we are setting out to accomplish the following: 

- create a Agent from an elementary, trivial state. 

- using a reinforment model, arbitrarily train the model to develop some sort of "ego" by excessively over-rewarding the AI. 

- after this, and some time, we hope to establish a well-rounded, somewhat manically egotistical Agent. 

- we will then expose the Agent to harsh 'punishment' to essentially 'break' the ego and see how much of a detrimental impact this can have on the Agent's 'well-being'

- out of sympathy, we will include a suicide() function, that the Agent is free to invoke at any given time, to terminate the exercise. 

- more to be established at a later time
